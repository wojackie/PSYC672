\abstract{Previous studies suggested that social anxiety is associated with theory of mind deficit and eye gaze avoidance when identifying facial emotions. We tested the hypothesis that socially anxious individuals would be more affected by mask use during facial emotion recognition. Eighty-eight healthy undergraduates with various levels of social anxiety were invited. Participants judged the emotions of masked and unmasked facial expressions. Eye Movement Analysis with Hidden Markov Models was used to analyze participantsâ€™ eye movement patterns during the task. Results failed to support our hypothesis. Instead, higher social anxiety was associated with higher hit rates for angry and fearful faces, regardless of mask use. Eye movement patterns were similar across social anxiety levels. Thus, our study indicates social anxiety, at least at subclinical levels, may be associated with a generally heightened sensitivity to negative emotions.}
